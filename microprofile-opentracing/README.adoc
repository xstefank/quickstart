[abstract]
The `microprofile-opentracing` quickstart demonstrates the use of the
MicroProfile OpenTracing specification in {productName}.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war
:archiveName: {artifactId}

== What is it?

MicroProfile OpenTracing allows users to track requests across service boundaries
which is necessary in the microservices architecture. It is based on
https://opentracing.io/. The MicroProfile OpenTracing provides a way to instrument
services with the distributed tracing function, given an existing distributed tracing
system in the environment (e.g. https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] or
https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin]).

== Architecture

In this quickstart, we have a collection of CDI beans and REST endpoints that
expose functionalities of the MicroProfile OpenTracing specification.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the
application step by step. However, you can go right to the completed example which
is available in this directory.

. Start your {productName} server

. Compile the application code and deploy it to {productName}
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

// Start the {productName} Standalone Server

== Creating the Maven Project

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing \
    -DartifactId=microprofile-opentracing \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
cd microprofile-opentracing
----

Open the project in your favourite IDE.

The first thing to do is to setup our dependencies. Add the following section to your
`pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- importing the jakartaee8-with-tools BOM adds specs and other useful artifacts as managed dependencies -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.bom</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-jakartaee8-with-tools</artifactId>
      <version>${version.server.bom}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

where `${version.server.bom}` is the version of your {productName}, in our case
"{productVersion}".

Now we need to add the following dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Import the MicroProfile OpenTracing API, we use provided scope as the API is included in WildFly -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile-opentracing-api</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- Import the CDI API, we use provided scope as the API is included in WildFly -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- Import the Jakarta REST API, we use provided scode as the API is included in WildFly -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jboss.spec.javax.ws.rs</groupId>
  <artifactId>jboss-jaxrs-api_2.1_spec</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

All dependencies can have provided scope.

As we are going to be deploying this application to the {productName} server, let's
also add a maven plugin that will simplify the deployment operations (you can replace
the generated build section):

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <!-- Set the name of the archive -->
  <finalName>${project.artifactId}</finalName>
  <plugins>
    <!-- Allows to use mvn wildfly:deploy -->
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

As this is a Jakarta REST application we need to also create an application class.
Create `org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing.JaxRsApplication` with the
following content:

NOTE: The new file should be created in
`src/main/java/org/wildfly/quickstart/microprofile/opentracing/JaxRsApplication.java`.

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/")
public class JaxRsApplication extends Application {
}
----

Now we are ready to start working with MicroProfile OpenTracing.

== Running the Jaeger service

To collect the traces from our application we will be using the Jaeger tracing system.
To run the Jaeger service we will use its Docker container.

NOTE: If you don't have Docker installed on your machine please follow the
instructions at https://www.docker.com/get-started.

Run the following command:

[source]
----
docker run --rm --name jaeger -p6831:6831/udp -p16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.16.0
----

NOTE: This can take a minute.

Now you can access `http://localhost:16686` in your browser to see the Jaeger UI
console.

Now we can start adding our custom spans from our application.


== Implicit tracing of REST resources

The MicroProfile OpenTracing specification provides an implicit tracing of all
JAX-RS resources. That means that an implementation of MicroProfile OpenTracing
will automatically:

* extract the Span context from the incoming JAX-RS request
* start a new Span on incoming JAX-RS request and close it when the request is
completed
* inject Span context to any outgoing JAX-RS request
* start a Span for any outgoing JAX-RS request and finish the Span when the
request is completed

Let's create a new JAX-RS resource to demonstrate this. Create a new class
`org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing.TracedResource`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
@ApplicationScoped
public class TracedResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/traced")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

That's it. There is no tracing code included in the application. All requests
to this resource will be traced.

Let's invoke our resource several times, so we can observe the created spans in the
Jaeger console:

Build and deploy the application

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

and make a few requests to the `TracedResource` by accessing
`http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/traced` in your browser or
by `curl http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/traced`. You will
see the spans created in the Jaeger console (`http://localhost:16686`) under the
service `microprofile-opentracing.war`.

Congratulations! We already have tracing with no instrumentation in the code. Let's
now dive into how we can fine tune the tracing in our applications.

== The @Traced annotation

The `@Traced` annotation can be used for:

* disabling the implicit instrumentation in JAX-RS resources
* define a custom operation name
* using tracing explicitly in non JAX-RS classes (see the next
<<explicit-traced,section>>)

To disable implicit tracing you can specify `@Traced(false)` on any JAX-RS resource
method to exclude it from distributed traces. Add the following method to the
`TracedResource` class:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/notTraced")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Traced(false)
public String notTraced() {
    return "notTraced";
}
----

And rebuild and deploy the application

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

NOTE: Because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13080[WFLY-13080] it is
also necessary to restart the server now (stop the server and rerun it again).

and make a few requests to the new endpoint by accessing
`http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/notTraced` in your browser or
by `curl http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/notTraced`. You will
see that the spans for these invocations are not created in the Jaeger console
(`http://localhost:16686`) under the service `microprofile-opentracing.war`. However,
if you repeat some calls to `http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/traced`
they will appear in the collected spans again.

To define a custom operation name we can pass it as an `operationName` parameter.
Update the `TracedResource` class:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/traced")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Traced(operationName = "hello-operation")
public String hello() {
    return "hello";
}
----

And rebuild and deploy the application

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

NOTE: Because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13080[WFLY-13080] it is
also necessary to restart the server now (stop the server and rerun it again).

and make a few requests to the endpoint by accessing
`http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/traced` in your browser or
by `curl http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/traced`. You will
see that the spans for these invocations are created with the custom name in the
Jaeger console (`http://localhost:16686`) under the service
`microprofile-opentracing.war`.


[[explicit-traced]]
== Explicit tracing with the @Traced annotation

By default, only the JAX-RS resources are traced. However, the `@Traced` annotation
is a CDI interceptor so we can use it in any CDI bean for more granular tracing
inside the service invocation. Create a new class
`org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing.ExplicitlyTracedBean`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing.Traced;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ExplicitlyTracedBean {

    @Traced
    public String getHello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

Note the explicit `@Traced` annotation on the `getHello()` method.

And update the `TracedResource` to use our newly defined bean:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private ExplicitlyTracedBean tracedBean;

@GET
@Path("/cdi-trace")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String cdiHello() {
    return tracedBean.getHello();
}
----

Build and redeploy the application

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

NOTE: Because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13080[WFLY-13080] it is
also necessary to restart the server now (stop the server and rerun it again).

and repeat a few requests to the `TracedResource` by accessing
`http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/cdi-trace` in your browser or
by `curl http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/cdi-trace`. You will
see the two created spans in the Jaeger console (`http://localhost:16686`) under the
service `microprofile-opentracing.war`. One for the JAX-RS call and one
for the CDI bean invocation.

== Tracer injection

For even more granular tracing, the MicroProfile OpenTracing allows you to inject
directly the configured `io.opentracing.Tracer` object.

To use `io.opentracing.Tracer` in our application we need to add one more maven
dependency providing the OpenTracing API:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Import the OpenTracing API for the use of io.opentracing.Tracer -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.opentracing</groupId>
  <artifactId>opentracing-api</artifactId>
  <version>0.31.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Now we can update the `ExplicitlyTracedBean`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.opentracing;

import io.opentracing.Span;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.opentracing.Traced;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ExplicitlyTracedBean {

    @Inject
    private Tracer tracer;

    @Traced
    public String getHello() {
        Span prepareHelloSpan = tracer.buildSpan("prepare-hello").start();

        String hello = "hello";

        Span processHelloSpan = tracer.buildSpan("process-hello").start();

        hello = hello.toUpperCase();

        processHelloSpan.finish();
        prepareHelloSpan.finish();

        return hello;
    }
}
----

Build and redeploy the application

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

NOTE: Because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13080[WFLY-13080] it is
also necessary to restart the server now (stop the server and rerun it again).

and repeat a few requests to the `TracedResource` by accessing
`http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/cdi-trace` in your browser or
by `curl http://localhost:8080/microprofile-opentracing/hello/cdi-trace`. You will
see now four created spans in the Jaeger console (`http://localhost:16686`) under the
service `microprofile-opentracing.war`. One for the JAX-RS call, one
for the CDI bean invocation and two manually created spans in the
`ExplicitlyTracedBean`.


== Conclusion

MicroProfile OpenTracing provides the mechanisms for your application to participate
in the distributed tracing with minimal effort on the application side. The JAX-RS
resources are always traced by default but the specification allows you to control
individual spans directly with the `@Traced` interceptor or with the CDI injection
of the `io.opentracing.Tracer`.
